    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>NexTGen Classes</strong> — a modern education platform designed to guide students 
      toward academic excellence, skill development, and real-world knowledge.
    </p>

    <!-- ABOUT YOU / THE FOUNDER -->
    <div class="section-box">
      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Ankush Chowrasia</strong>, a dedicated student and an aspiring attorney with a passion 
        for research, education, and technology. I study in <strong>ISC Class 11 (Arts)</strong> with subjects like  
        Modern English, Political Science, History, Sociology, Geography, and Physical Education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond academics, I am deeply interested in <strong>AI, law, content creation, and educational development</strong>.  
        I have experience creating study materials, sample papers, solved notes, and helping students with academic 
        guidance across multiple subjects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through consistent hard work, discipline, and leadership, I have developed a strong foundation in teaching, 
        presentation, and content-building — skills that directly shaped the creation of NexTGen Classes.
